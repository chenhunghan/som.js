The Self-Organizing Map(SOM) in Pure Javascript 

We plan to translate the core methods of SOM algorithm, which is elaborated in "[MATLAB Implementations and Applications of the Self-Organizing Map](http://docs.unigrafia.fi/publications/kohonen_teuvo/MATLAB_implementations_and_applications_of_the_self_organizing_map.pdf)", from MATLAB into javascript.

The implementation will be written in javascript/typescript and could be used in modern browsers and node.js env. It is depended on these libs for matrix and array operations:
